HELLO!
Thank you for downloading Scribble Board!

--NOTE-- Please refer to the instructional video, which covers all these instructions in an easy to understand format --NOTE--

***Instructions***

There are a couple things to know in order to use Scribble Board effectively.
1. At the top of the page is your toolbar, it contains the different drawing tools (pen, eraser, rectangle, line, circle, text creator), and the different colors
2. Here is how each tool* works:
	pen. Click on the pen tool. Then click and drag on the canvas. Once you let go, the line will be created. Due to the iterations of the loop, this can sometimes take long to render.
	eraser. This tools erases a rectangle. Click the eraser tool. Then click the top left point of the rectangle and the bottom right point. Everything in that area will be erased.
	rectangle. This is the same as eraser but with color. Click the tool, then the top left corner and then bottom right corner.
	line. Click the line tool. Then click the first point on the canvas, and then the second point. A line will be made between the two points.
	circle. Click the circle tool. Your first click on the canvas is the centerpoint, and the second click is the radius based on the center point
	colors. Click whichever color is desired. Then click the canvas. Now you can use the tools in that color. Default color is black
	text**. Click the text tool. Click on the canvas where you want the center of the text to be. An input box will appear: type in your message. Another one will appear: type the size of the text (8-40)

PRO TIP: If you seem to be encountering a problem, click the canvas twice and then once again try to use the tool/color. Clicking the canvas will generally fix most issues!

Housekeeping:
In order to have a pleasant experience with this program, here are things to know about how it works
1. When moving from canvas to toolbar, move straight to the tool you wish to use. If you go from the canvas to the circle tool, and then decide you want to make a line, you need to first go back to the canvas, click it once, and then move straight to the line tool.
2. Once again, after clicking a color, remember to click on the canvas again before using tools.
3. After closing the program, make sure you stop the script with the red button. furthermore, if you use the CLOSE button, you need to restart calico in order to open Scribble Board again.


*note: For all these tools, if the shape drawn interferes with the toolbar, it won't be made. 
**when you start the program please move the window to the right. Otherwise, when the text tool is used, the input boxes will be behind the Scribble Board window
